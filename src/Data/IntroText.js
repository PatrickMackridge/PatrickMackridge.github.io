Head over to the projects page to see the various projects I am either working on or have previously worked on. From there you can click through to the applications themselves, or check out their GitHub repos. If you want to know anything more about me or my projects you can get in touch via the contact page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks!";
